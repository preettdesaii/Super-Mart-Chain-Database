# Super-Mart-Chain-Database
A comprehensive database schema designed to manage and organize the operations of a super mart chain. This project includes data models for inventory management, sales tracking, customer information, and supplier relationships, enabling efficient business insights and streamlined operations.

#### Introduction
This Readme file provides an overview of the technical aspects of the Super Mart chain Database Project. The project aims to design and implement a database system tailored for a new super mart corporation similar to Costco and Walmart, named ABC. This database will manage various aspects of the corporation's operations, including sales, customers, employees, and stores, to facilitate efficient business management and analysis.

#### Overview
The database will store and manage data related to ABC's sales, customers, employees, and stores, supporting both online and offline ordering options. It will handle online transactions, shipment information, payment details, and membership information. The goal is to ensure data accuracy and accessibility for business analytical purposes and to enhance customer experience.

#### Design Decisions
Key design factors include the entity-relationship model, functional design decisions, choice of Database Management System (Oracle Database 12c), and security and privacy measures. The database design prioritizes modularity, scalability, and adherence to SQL norms.

#### Business Understanding
The database aims to mitigate data inconsistencies by ensuring specific, complete, and consistent data collection across all business components. It will provide valuable insights for market trends, consumer behavior analysis, and strategic decision-making.

#### Project Scope
The scope includes designing the database, implementing appropriate relationships, documenting requirements, creating an Entity-Relationship diagram, and providing sample Data Definition Language (DDL) and Manipulation Language (DML) scripts.

#### Database Goals and Expectations
The database will hold metadata, entities, primary keys, attributes, and relationships with proper constraints and normalization techniques to reduce data redundancy. Deliverables include detailed documentation and scripts.

#### Database Benefits
The database will benefit both consumers and store operators by providing a seamless shopping experience, real-time updates on product availability, order tracking, and efficient management of inventory, orders, and employees.

#### Project Management Methodology
The project will initially follow a structured approach similar to the waterfall model, transitioning to iterative methodologies to accommodate evolving requirements and ensure collaboration between the database and software development teams.

#### SQL Usage and Style
The project adheres to specific SQL usage and style guidelines to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of the database scripts.

#### Entity and Attribute Description
Detailed descriptions of entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality constraints are provided, outlining the structure and functionality of the database.
